Instructions 

INSTALLATION:


To run the script 

1. run requirements.txt 
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt


- Python3 installation instructions: https://realpython.com/installing-python/
- Create a project directory dedicated for this application.
- Place 'main_program.py' and 'unit_tests.py' inside the project directory.

2. From inside the project directory:

- Enable virtual environment:

$ python3 -m venv env

3. - Activate the virtual environment:

source env/bin/activate

4. - Flask installation: 

$ pip install Flask


TESTING:
   (unit_tests.py)

The 6 unit tests check the bahaviour of the application with 6 different list types: 
 - current list hardcoded in the application;
 - an empty list;
 - list which is bigger than the maximum allowed size;
 - list with mixed type elements;
 - list with negative numbers;
 - list with mixed number types, including integers and floats.


- While virtual environment is still active, run the unit test first, from the project directory:

$ python3 unit_tests.py

All 6 tests should pass

RUNNING:
(main_program.py)

- While virtual environment is still active, run 'main_program.py' from within the project directory:

$ python3 main_program.py

- On a web-browser, navigate to: http://localhost:5000/total

- After running the application, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running: 
 
$ deactivate


ASSUMPTIONS:

- Application is run in an environment which supports Python3 and third-party libraries used
- Application is run in an environment which allows HTTP requests to localhost and does not have any process occupying port 5000
- This application will not have widespread use therefore testing is done only on codeâ€™s critical behaviours
